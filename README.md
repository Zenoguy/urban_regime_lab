# **urban-regime-lab**

*A living research notebook exploring urban thermal regimes, instability fields, and physics-geometry coupling across cities.*

This repository is an **exploration space / working lab notebook** for experiments, prototypes, and early findings from an ongoing research project on:

* urban thermal regime structure
* temporal instability transitions
* physics–geometry coupling (Δα, Ψ, persistence)
* cross-city generalization and transfer dynamics

The goal of this repo is **not** to present a polished framework — but to maintain a transparent, time-stamped trail of:

* ideas in motion
* exploratory notebooks
* intermediate figures
* experimental failures & insights
* conceptual pivots and refinements

Think of this as the *scratchpad where the science actually happens*.

A cleaner, refactored framework repo will eventually sit alongside this one.

## 🧪 **What lives in this repo**

This repository primarily contains:

* Google Colab notebooks
* exploratory visualizations
* preliminary analyses
* pipeline drafts & prototypes

Notebooks are committed regularly to preserve:

* experiment history
* contribution trail
* reasoning process over time

Outputs and interpretations may evolve across commits —
that is intentional and part of the research workflow.

## 🧭 **Research context (high-level)**

Core questions being explored:

1. Do cities exhibit **stable thermal regime structures** (core / buffer / transition belts)?
2. How do temporal instability dynamics relate to:

   * multifractality fields (Δα)
   * persistence / memory
   * geometry–physics coupling (Ψ)?
3. Are these behaviors:

   * city-specific
   * climate-zone-dependent
   * or partially universal?
4. Can temporal GNNs **transfer regime dynamics across cities**?

This repo tracks the exploratory phase of that journey —
including trials that *may or may not* survive into the final framework.

## 📂 **Repo structure**

```
notebooks/
  phaseXX.ipynb

figures/
  (key exploratory plots & snapshots)

scratch/
  notes, temp outputs, sandbox code
```

Naming convention:

* notebooks are date-prefixed
* each notebook documents its motivation + observations

Nothing here is considered final or canonical.

## 🔍 **How to read these notebooks**

These notebooks are meant to be read as:

* experiment logs
* thinking-out-loud spaces
* visual reasoning artifacts

They often include:

* partial pipelines
* incremental plots
* interpretation notes
* “what-if” experiments

Some cells may be messy or redundant —
that reflects **how insight actually forms**.

---

## 🏗️ **Future direction**

As components stabilize, they will be:

* refactored into reusable Python modules
* migrated into a separate **clean framework repo**
* accompanied by curated notebooks + documentation

That sibling repository will focus on:

* reproducibility
* structured pipeline design
* public-facing research artifacts

This repo remains the **exploratory engine**.

---

## 🤝 **Collaboration & credit**

This lab notebook is updated frequently to maintain:

* authorship traceability
* transparent contribution history
* scientific accountability

If you’re reading this as a collaborator and want context,
feel free to open an issue or start a discussion thread.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **work-in-progress research space**.

Expect:

* evolving interpretations
* unfinished ideas
* abandoned experiments
* occasional wrong turns

Everything here is exploratory by design.

---

## ✨ Closing note

This repository exists to capture the *process*, not just the conclusions.

If something here looks rough —
it probably means the idea is still alive and moving.
